# ⚛️ MetaBrix License Plan

**Author:** Giannis Tsioukis  
**Project:** MetaBrix — Engineering the Human Operating System  
**Version:** Draft 0.1  
**Date:** 2025-11-10

---

## 🧭 Purpose
This document explains how MetaBrix intends to handle licensing, intellectual property, and open collaboration as the project grows.  
It is **not a final legal license**, but a transparent plan for contributors and potential partners.

---

## 1. Current Stage — All Rights Reserved
Until the official license is published, all MetaBrix repositories and blueprints are released under **“All Rights Reserved”** status.  
This means:

- The code and documentation are publicly viewable.  
- Reuse, redistribution, or commercial deployment is **not permitted** without explicit permission.  
- MetaBrix retains full ownership and copyright of all materials.

This protects the early research phase while allowing collaborators to read, discuss, and ideate openly.

---

## 2. Transition Plan — MetaBrix Open Innovation Charter
As the community grows, MetaBrix will publish its **custom license** and **open innovation charter**, modeled after the *Business Source License (BSL 1.1)*.

### Draft Intentions:
- **Free for personal, educational, or research use.**
- **Commercial or hosted services** require explicit permission or a commercial license from MetaBrix.
- **Transparency and contribution** are encouraged under contributor agreements (to protect intellectual integrity).
- After a defined period (e.g. 3 years), code may transition to an **open license** such as Apache 2.0.

This system keeps the **ethics of open science** while ensuring MetaBrix can **sustain itself financially** and reward innovation.

## 3. Future Licensing Structure (Roadmap)
| Layer | License Type | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| **MetaBrix Core (AI + Chemistry Engine)** | Business Source License (BSL 1.1) | Protects commercial rights |
| **MetaBrix SDKs & APIs** | Apache 2.0 | Encourages community expansion |
| **Nutrion App (Consumer layer)** | Proprietary / Commercial | Enables revenue and product stability |
| **Hardware (MetaBand, Nanochip)** | Hybrid (open firmware + protected design) | Collaboration-friendly, IP-secure |

---

## 4. Why This Approach
MetaBrix exists at the intersection of **science, AI, and hardware**.  
We must protect our ability to **fund long-term research** while keeping our technology **transparent and ethical**.

This license plan:
- Encourages collaboration with researchers and innovators.  
- Prevents corporate misuse or cloning during early growth.  
- Lays the groundwork for sustainable open science.

---

## 5. Contributor Ethos
By contributing ideas, documentation, or code, you acknowledge that:
- All contributions will follow the MetaBrix open charter.  
- MetaBrix will credit all contributors transparently.  
- Commercial rights remain under MetaBrix management until official relicensing.
