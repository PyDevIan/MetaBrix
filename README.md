# ⚛️ MetaBrix — Engineering the Human Operating System

**Founder:** Giannis Tsioukis  
**Mission:** Merge AI, Chemistry, and Engineering to rebuild the foundation of human optimization — from molecular nutrition to intelligent robotics.

---

## 🧬 Vision
MetaBrix is a frontier research and development collective building **AI systems that understand, interpret, and enhance life itself.**  
We’re designing a future where technology doesn’t just *serve* humans — it *augments* them intelligently, safely, and ethically.

> **Our credo:** “Where biology meets code.”

## 🌿 Current Project — Nutrion
**Nutrion** is MetaBrix’s first open initiative.  
A live AI system that reads your physiology and behavior in real time to recommend exactly what your body needs — nutrition, hydration, and recovery — with chemical accuracy.

### Goals
- Fuse **AI + Wearables + Chemistry + Nutrition Science**  
- Develop the **MetaBand** — an intelligent wearable integrating multi-sensors (HR, HRV, glucose, temperature, hydration markers)  
- Evolve toward **nanochip or micro-sensor systems** for non-invasive biochemical monitoring  
- Build **adaptive models** that learn your metabolism over time  

**Tech Stack:**  
Python (PyTorch, FastAPI), Core ML / TF Lite, React Native, hardware integration via BLE & embedded microcontrollers (ESP32, STM32).

## 🧩 Open Collaboration
We’re building in the open and calling all curious minds.

### Looking For:
- 🧠 **AI Engineers** — modeling, data fusion, online learning  
- ⚙️ **Robotics / Embedded Engineers** — wearable integration, sensor design  
- ⚗️ **Chemists / Biochemists** — biomarkers, reaction modeling, metabolomics  
- 🍎 **Nutrition Scientists** — macronutrient algorithms, metabolic modeling  
- 💡 **Designers / UI Thinkers** — interfaces for human–AI symbiosis  
- 🔬 **Philosophers / Ethicists** — shaping augmentation ethics and access

If your blood vibrates at the intersection of **code and biology**, we want you.

## 🧠 Why MetaBrix
- We believe *technology should free time and expand capacity*, not enslave users.  
- We build **open, transparent systems** — intelligence that belongs to humanity.  
- Our focus: **autonomy, mastery, health, and the evolution of intelligence itself.**

## 🧩 Philosophy
> “Every system we build should return time, clarity, and capability to the human.”

This is not a company. It’s a movement — toward intelligent autonomy and ethical augmentation.
